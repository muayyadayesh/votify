## notes:
- Settings changed for deployment
- SQLite flushed for deployment
- Used the Bootstrap
- Used the CBVs mainly
- Used Chart.js for charts
- Used 'LoginRequiredMixin' only with only adding a 'New Poll'
- Advanced checks & features & validations ignored
- Finally, I excluded 'virtualenv' from uploaded files & removed '.gitignore' from the whole project


## Extended Requirements in the project:
- [x] Display relative time of when a poll was created on the dashboard page
- [x] Display a chart or graph of the voting results
- [x] Ensure the questions asked are unique
- [x] Use front-end validations in addition to the back-end validations (Not for everything, but important things)
